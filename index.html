                <h4>Network</h4>
                <p>
                A network consists of two or more computers connected for the
                purpose of communicating and sharing resources.

                A client is a computer that connects to and uses the resources of a
                remote computer, or server.

               A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a
              LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet
              includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data)
              being transferred. When the packets reach their destination, they
              are reassembled into a single file or other contiguous block of
              data.

              Protocols are rules that describe how clients and servers
              communicate with each other over a network. There are many
              different protocols with different purposes. These protocols are
              implemented by operating systems, browsers, and networking
              devices.

                <p>
              The File Transfer Protocol is a set of rules for exchanging files
              over the internet. Unlike HTTP which is used to ask for the entire
              webpage and it's files to display them, FTP is used only to move a
              file from one computer to another. FTP is commonly used by web
              developers when they want to tranfer their local files from their
              computer to the server and vice versa.

              HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for
              transferring files -- such as text, images, sound, video and other
              multimedia files -- over the web.

              Stands for "Post Office Protocol." POP3, sometimes referred to as
              just "POP," is a simple, standardized method of delivering e-mail
              messages. A POP3 mail server receives e-mails and filters them
              into the appropriate user folders. When a user connects to the
              mail server to retrieve his mail, the messages are downloaded from
              mail server to the user's hard disk.

                <p>
                 
              SMTP is used to send and receive email. It is sometimes paired
              with IMAP or POP3 (for example, by a user-level application),
              which handles the retrieval of messages, while SMTP primarily
              sends messages to a server for forwarding. SMTP can both send and
              receive mail, but it's bad at queuing incoming messages, hence the
              common delegation to other protocols.

              An IP address is a numeric ID given to each device connected to
              the internet. Every network has a public IP address and every
              device in the network has a private IP address. IP addresses
              sometimes correspond to domain names. The Domain Name System
              associates IP addresses with URLs with domain names.

              <h4>What events and technologies helped the internet grow in the early 90s?</h4>
              <p>
                The world wide web grew in the 90s because of the development of the web browser, which allowed individuals to access the web from several operating systems. That browser was initially called the worldwide web. It started in 1991 with the development of Linux. Then there was text messaging that started in 1992. Accessibility for everyone was important. In addition, websites became ubiquitous. These relied on domain names, which were text strings that assigned numeric IP addresses to client software. These allowed clients, which refers to any computer hardware or software, that requests access to services provided by servers, to connect to the web. In 1998 Google was founded, which brought about the era of search engines. When it comes to the internet, there is a phonebook commonly called the DNS, the Domain Name Service, which is what clients use to request access to specific websites. Emails also helped in making the internet popular, using IMAP and POP for instance. FTP, the file transfer protocol also became popular in terms of transferring computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.

              <h4>What is the purpose of organizations like W3C and IETF?</h4>
              <p>
                W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium, founded in 1994, which maintains the standards for the world wide web. It also helps in the education of individuals as well as develops software for the web. In addition, W3C also brings about compatibility among different industry members about adopting the same set of standards. IETF refers to the Internet Engineering Task Force, which is principally an international community of designers, researchers and vendors who have helped with both the evolution of the internet as well as its operation. The initial purpose of the IETF, when established in 1986, was the coordination, management and evolution of the internet.

              <h4>Why should you put extra effort into making websites more accessible?</h4>
              <p>
                The primary purpose is to increase the reach of the website in terms of its audience.  Non accessibility simply means that individuals will not engage with the content, and one may lose out on earnings. In addition, accessibility increases search engine optimization: it makes it easier to discover for users, for instance via Google search. A more accessible website also gives one more of a competitive edge and helps with public relations.

                <h4>What is intellectual property?</h4>
                <p>
                  Any product of the human intellect that is protected by law from unauthorized usage by others. In a way this creates a limited monopoly in terms of protected property. The primary purpose of intellectual property laws is compensation to authors and inventors: the works are produced for the benefit of the public, while compensating the people who made the work. The regulation of patents and copyrights derives from the intellectual property clause of the Constitution.

                <p>
                  Ethical use, based on WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) standards, is very specific. Creative Commons is a legal venue of sharing knowledge and work that gives specific guidelines as to how intellectual property can be used, and should be followed in using images, audio and video created by someone else. However, if something is in the public domain, it is not protected by copyright law and can be freely copied, shared, altered or republished.

                <p>
                  Cascading Style Sheets is used for the styling and laying out of webpages, and can be used to adjust content size and spacing for instance. It is added to HTML in three ways: inline, by using style attributes inside HTML elements, internal, by using the <style> element in the <head>, and external by using a <link> element to an external CSS file.
